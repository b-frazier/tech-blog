    "post_body": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language, such as HTML. CSS is used to control the layout and presentation of web pages and other documents, providing a way to separate the content of a document from its visual appearance. With CSS, you can specify things like the font and color of text, the background color and image of a page, and the position and size of elements on the page. By using CSS, you can create consistent and attractive styles across multiple pages and improve the accessibility and usability of your website."
